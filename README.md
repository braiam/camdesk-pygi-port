Porting following https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Novacut/GStreamer1.0

Many things are not yet working.
Broken:
-video appears in new window ~
-no settings window yet

What has been done:
- Changes folowing the porting guide
- All indents are using four spaces even on line breaks (or python3 complains)

What needs to be done:
- somehow connect the video to widget
- settings window is broke, debug and fix
- anything else
- look for and implement new stuff (talk to creator?)
